# Switch Costs

## Synopsis
Demonstrates the mental effort in switching attention from one task to another. Multi-tasking - doing more than one task at a time - involves switching attention; make sure students understand this as a way this task connects with their lives.

Note the powerpoint directly references the article. Take that out if not having them read it.

Powerpoint is otherwise straightforward. 

The statistics involved are straightforward, so this can be done early in the semester. 

## To Do:
1. The task now works (I updated the original file), but it's displayed in a 
small window. We should make it fullscreen.
2. The introductory instructions appear well off center, this should be fixed.
3. The key mapping is completely unintuitive and should be changed
4. The response mapping for the two tasks should remain visible during trials,
preferably printed in the corresponding task colors.
5. The ITI seems unusually long. Check to determine whether this is intentional
and/or necessary.

In MacOS
-seems to work.  Agree with point 2. 
-ITI is initential; subject can change it.
-no data file(s)
-have to check if this is true:
                    This is whether the tasks are predictable (you always have the five trials of one task before the task    switches [P]), or unpredictable (the task is randomly chosen each trial [U])
