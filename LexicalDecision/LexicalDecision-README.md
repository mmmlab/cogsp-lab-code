# Lexical Decision Task

## Synopsis
Students should read the power point before doing the task

Students need to download the psychopy code (.py) AND the two excel files in order for the program to work. 

This is a good task to do an ANOVA on, as there are four values to the independent variable. Thus, itâ€™s a good task to do towards the end of the semester. There is an excellent, step-by-step .pdf on how to run the ANOVA in Excel. 

You can do it earlier with a simple t-test, comparing the reaction time when the words were related to the reaction time when the words were not. Note you will need to give the students explicit instructions on how to format the data if you do a t-test; read the ANOVA .pdf for an idea as to how explicit. 

## To Do:
1. Check warnings regarding PTB sound engine and screen size
2. Perhaps insert trial start keypress and/or counter. At the moment this is a 
very long block not to allow the student to take an optional break.
