# Tone Discrimination

## Synopsis

This has students decide whether two tones are the same or not. The phenomenon is not necessarily interesting in and of itself, but the results are. 

The experimental format demonstrates psychophysics. If you don’t know what this is, please see the coordinator immediately.

The results can be plotted in Excel. There is also a document under line length (LineLengthAssignment_Week1_part2) that explains how to get the difference threshold. 

This experiment is a sensation & perception experiment, but it can be done early. It can be tied into Cognition in that we make discriminations between people’s voices, _emotions_ in people’s voices, people’s faces, etc. and this is part of the basic perceptual work that goes into making those kinds of discriminations.

## To Do:
1. Maybe set to full screen (not critical since this is an audio experiment).
2. Check and perhaps change default parameter settings in popup dialog.
3. Reduce the number of parameters in the popup dialog. It currently looks
cluttered and confusing.
4. Change code to be proper 2IFC. I.e.,
    - the order of standard and comparison should be randomized on each trial
    - the question should ask whether the second tone was higher or lower than
    the first.
