# Mental Rotation

## Synopsis
Don’t let students use the mental rotation version that is one of the examples that comes with PsychoPy. This has been slightly modified to fit our purposes.

Make sure students realize they have to download all four files in order to run the experiment: the .py file, the two .png files, and the .csv file

Students should read the power point before doing the experiment. 

It is unlikely that the students will be able to do a correlation statistical test. Thus, it’s best to run this early before you are asking them to do stats every week. 


Notes:
seems to work in MacOS.  The welcoming screen with the example is not displayed correctly.
