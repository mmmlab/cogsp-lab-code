# Motion

## Synopsis
This experiment is a perceptual experiment. It demonstrates how we put little 
bits of motion together to create a coherent whole. 

Please look at the website linked in the Sakai folder so you know what the 
students are doing.

The powerpoint is fairly comprehensive. There is no specific statistics listed 
in the powerpoint, so if you wanted to do this early and not use statistics you 
could. Alternatively, students would need to run an ANOVA on it. 

## To Do:
1. These experiments all use a png image to display the instructions. This should
be converted to normal text graphics, so that it scales well and can be modified
as  necessary.
2. The experiments are presented inside a small window. They should be converted
to full-screen.
3. Shares same issue with some other experiments in using deprecated 
`TextStim.alignVert` and `TextStim.alignHoriz` methods. These should be updated.
4. The second `Motion2-Aperture.py` and third `Motion3-ApertureWidth` experiments 
run but look funny. I'm not completely convinced that the stimulus is being 
rendered correctly. Read the relevant references and determine whether the 
stimuli are correct.
