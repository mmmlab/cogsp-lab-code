\f0\fs24 \cf0 Attentional Blink - read-me\
\
Attentional Blink is when you don\'92t notice something if it happens a specific and rather short period of time right after something else. See the article if you are not familiar with the term.\
\
As this is attention, it can be done in either the Cognition lab or the Sensation & Perception lab. \
\
The exercise asks the subjects to say whether there was an X in an RSVP format, after they\'92ve found a letter in a different color font. \
\
The power-point is rather spare, and spends a lot of time describing how to format the results. Feel free to add more detail about the actual exercise and psychological phenomenon.\
\
For results, you want the students to count the number of times they missed the X, and track how that changes over the number of letters there were between the target and the X. You can either have them present just means, or have them do an ANOVA, so you have some flexibility about when to do this exercise }
